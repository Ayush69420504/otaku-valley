This readme has been added two years after i made this.
I was young and did not know the importance of a readme.

This uses a html scrapper, to scrap data from a website back in the day called streamani.net

Three purposes.
1. Scrap search result and shows a simplified search result in webpage, (only text, no image)
2. Scraps a certain chosen anime's info page, episode list, and depening on chosen episode, it scraps the video player
3. It scraps mangafox for manga names but cannot scrap the pages and view it.

So what now:
It does not work, streamani has changed the webpage, ofcourse.
The manga part still works as mangafox page has not been changed!.

Future thoughts.
I am planning to make a rebirth of this project.
Changes:
1. Add a style file for both handhelds and desktop format screens
2. Use better styling options, i know it is basic
3. actually make code which does not break with a source that is everlasting (gogoanime)
4. I think using the legacy of the yt-dlp library will help me a lot with data extraction
5. Thats it.
